        <h1>String Processing Algorithm</h1>
        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)">
            In computer programming, a string is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of 
            variable. The latter may allow its elements to be mutated and the length changed, or it may be fixed (after creation). 
            A string is generally considered as a data type and is often implemented as an array data structure of bytes (or words) that stores 
            a sequence of elements, typically characters, using some character encoding. String may also denote more general arrays or 
            other sequence (or list) data types and structures.
